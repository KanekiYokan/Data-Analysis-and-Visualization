# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Welcome to the Data Visualization Project! A simple project where we will explore, analyze, and visualize data. 
Through this journey, we aim to uncover insights and tell compelling stories with data.

## Introduction

Data analysis and visualization are crucial components of data science. They help us understand data, uncover patterns, and communicate insights effectively. In this project, we will analyze and visualize a publicly available dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
1. **Load and preprocess the data:** Handle missing values, and outliers, and transform the data for analysis.
2. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):** Generate summary statistics and visualize the data to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Create visualizations:** Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative and aesthetically pleasing plots.

## Dataset Description

The dataset we will be using is the ["Titanic-Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/data). 
Below are the main features of the dataset:

- **PassengerId:** Passenger ID
- **Survived:** Weather Survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass:** Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name:** Name of the Passenger
- **Sex:** Gender
- **Age:** Age in Years
- **SibSp:** No. of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch:** No. of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket:** Ticket number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number
- **Embarked:** Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Tools and Libraries

We will be using the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Transform and clean the data as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Visualize the distribution of features.
   - Identify correlations and relationships between features.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Create bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
   - Use Seaborn for advanced visualizations like pair plots and heatmaps.
   - Customize plots for better readability and presentation.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we aim to:
- Gain insights from the dataset through analysis and visualizations.
- Enhance our skills in using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Communicate our findings effectively through well-designed plots and charts.

Let's get started with our data analysis and visualization journey!
